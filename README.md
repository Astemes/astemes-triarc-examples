# Triarc-Examples
Example code templates for Triarc.
Documentation for Triarc is found [here](https://astemes.github.io/astemes-triarc-framework/).
The repository contains two example applications, the Thermal Chamber and the Coffee Shop.
The Thermal Chamber is a Triarc implementation of the example shipped with DQMH with the same name.
The Coffee Shop is an implementation of the Actor Framework example using Triarc.

## Installation
The code may either be cloned directly from the git repository or installed into the LabVIEW examples directory using the VI Pacakge file published under releases.
To run the examples you will need to install [Triarc Framework](https://github.com/Astemes/astemes-triarc-framework).
The code was developed using test driven development and if you want to execute the tests you will need [LUnit](https://github.com/Astemes/astemes-lunit).

## Useage
Once the needed dependencies are installed, the code may be executed directly by opening the VIs from the LabVIEW project files.
You can view messages sent between the processes in real-time using the [Triarc Debugger](https://github.com/Astemes/astemes-triarc-debugger).
